Services Offered
👋 Development Engineer (Unity3D, Web, Software) — I help project owners move from idea to implementation, with methodology, vision, and technical expertise.

💡 Do you have an idea? Let's make sure it's as clear for a developer as it is for you.

✨ I love exploring the potential of projects. Imagining what they can become and what they can bring to the world.

📌 But an idea, however brilliant, needs a well-thought-out roadmap to become reality.

Together, we will:
✅ Clarify your project – put it into words and structure
✅ Establish a coherent roadmap – key stages that remain flexible
✅ Translate your vision for technical teams
✅ Anticipate developments – plan for integration from the start
✅ Maximize chances of success – not just feasible, but remarkable
🎯 Then? I can also take charge of or co-develop your application, tool, or prototype: Unity3D, web, business software, simulation, etc.

Technologies Used
Three.js: 3D engine for the web
JavaScript: Interaction programming
HTML/CSS: Page structure and styling
GLTF/GLB: 3D model format
How to Run
