# Transition Video Implementation

## Overview
Added a transition video that plays between the loading overlay closing and the camera animation starting. The video uses the `Spongebubble.webm` file located in `public/images/`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Video Element Addition
- Added `<video id="transitionVideo">` element to `portfolio.html`
- Video is hidden by default (`display: none`)
- High z-index (10000) to appear above all other elements
- Video covers the full screen with `object-fit: cover`

### 2. Timing Specifications
- **Video playback starts**: When user clicks to close loading overlay
- **Loading overlay hides**: At 675ms of video playback (as requested)
- **Camera animation starts**: After video ends completely

### 3. Modified Functions

#### `portfolio.html` changes:
- **`hideLoadingOverlay()`**: Now plays transition video instead of immediately hiding overlay
- **Video initialization**: Sets video properties (muted, playsInline, preload)
- **Skip logic**: Handles returning from contact page by skipping transition

#### `main.js` changes:
- **`checkAndStartCinematic()`**: Now waits for both overlay hidden AND video finished
- **Helper functions**: Added `getTransitionVideo()` and `isTransitionVideoPlaying()`

### 4. Flow Sequence
1. Assets load in background
2. User clicks/taps to close loading overlay
3. Transition video starts playing immediately
4. At 675ms: Loading overlay fades out (but video continues)
5. Video ends: Camera animation begins
6. Video element is hidden

### 5. Error Handling
- **Video fails to play**: Falls back to immediate overlay hiding
- **Video doesn't exist**: Falls back to immediate overlay hiding  
- **Timeout protection**: Video auto-hides after 3 seconds maximum
- **Returning from contact**: Skips both overlay and video entirely

### 6. Browser Compatibility
- Video is muted to allow autoplay in all browsers
- Uses `playsInline` for iOS compatibility
- WebM format with fallback message
- Error handling for unsupported browsers

### 7. Performance Optimizations
- Video preloading (`preload="auto"`)
- No background color to maintain transparency
- Pointer events disabled during playback
- Event listeners cleaned up after use

## Files Modified
1. `portfolio.html`: Added video element, modified loading logic
2. `main.js`: Updated cinematic animation triggers

## Testing
Run local server: `python -m http.server 8000`
Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/portfolio.html`

The transition should be smooth and timed precisely at 675ms as requested.
